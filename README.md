amateur media player i made in 2013 when i was studying java programming, i used outdated JVLC project, i found it in old disc and i want to share if i can help someone for something . There is also a setup with .libs from an old version of VLC and java7 to test, the player works for me, I hope for you too. Forgive code, I was still learning.
there is a lot of Java class using JVLC options. To execute the Main Player You must execute the class " Player" with java 8 or java8 or previous version up to java 6.
NB: You must to create "plugins" directory and copy plugins VLC 2.1/3 files to test the player. Just for fun you can download windows 
setup to my google drive link : https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Cm7lIF-Xy2rXhv03HEjUyOV3kx5CJXSI/view?usp=sharing
Just for fun!!!
